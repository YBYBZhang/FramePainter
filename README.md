FramePainter allows users to manipulate images through intuitive sketches.
Benefiting from powerful video diffusion priors, it not only enables intuitive and plausible edits in common scenarios, but also exhibits exceptional generalization in out-of-domain cases, e.g., transform the fish into a shark-like shape.
